Flying all the way to north from Syracuse via Seattle, we finally reach Anchorage, which is the first stop during our one-week-long stay in the northmost state of America, Alaska. Starting from here, we will explore around the city, drive along AK-1 S and State Hwy 9 to Seward looking forward to catching a glimpse of whales and glaciers in the Resurrection Bay, search the highest peak of North America in Denali National Park, hunt northern lights in the outskirts of Fairbanks, and enjoy the stunning scenery from up above in our flight back to Anchorage.

Upon disembarking in Anchorage, I am immediately attracted to the mountains at a distance, ones that are covered with snow even in springtime. Looking through the window at the airport, I'm conviced that I won't get bored in the coming days with views like this. I'm more aware that I NEED to get closer to them and take some fine shots.

After renting our jeep, we drive down south towards Seward. The landscape along the highway is unforgettably amazing while we're driving across mountains and lakes. In company with the main road lies a seemingly endless railway. Unfortunately, trains in this season are not so frequent, and it turns out we don't stand a chance of appreciating the gorgeous scenery on a train. In retrospect, we are already planning on going back in the summer and take the train.

On our way I spot a place called Chugach National Forest and I ask my fellows to stop and stare. This is a perfect viewpoint to photograph Kenai Lake and its surroundings. We collect flagstones that are used to pave the railroad and start playing ducks and drakes. Although I cannot retrieve my childhood skill and fail to achieve even a second bounce, this is still a lot of fun.

After our brief stop by the lake, we continue to head for Seward, where we will spend four hours cruising around Resurrection Bay in order to look for various kinds of sea animals.
