Seward is a city along the Gulf of Alaska coast. It is our second stopover in Alaska. The lifestyle and architectures here keep reminding me of Switzerland, which I should probably touch on in my coming posts. Well, that is a bit off the topic. Head straight to the harbor, get on the boat. and we are about to sail off!

The cruise is two hours each way and goes deep into Resurrection Bay, giving us sufficient time to catch sight of numerous wildlife living in this area. Shortly after setting off, we find two eagles (I guess probably they are bald eagles) standing on the drilling station. As a landscape photographer, I have to confess I am not good at taking telephotos. The shots turn out to be not bad at all. I am amazed by how sharp the images are taken with the kit lens of the Cannon camera I borrowed. The autofocus is superb compared with my Pentax K1. That said, Pentax is still my go-to camera for landscape and nature photos. Image quality with its pixel shift technology is just second to none in the world of full frame DSLRs.

Sailing on, we see a harmonious biosphere here in the water. Two giant rocks sit above the water body. One is the habitat of seals, and the other is the habitat of seagulls. They seem to live symbiotically with a clear boundary.

The main purpose of this boat trip is, of course, to look for whales. Thanks to the experienced crew, we pinpoint three or four of them. But we are not the luckiest tourists. They are too shy to show off their signature tails. Fast as they are moving, I still manage to capture a photo where a pillow of water is formed when one of them is exhaling through its blowhole. The pressure must be quite high, given the height of the water it blows.

We are very satisfied with the cruise and will definitely revisit, hopefully in the near future. Now, we are heading all the way north to Fairbanks! Alert! It'll be a long long trip.
