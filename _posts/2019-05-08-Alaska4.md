title: Alaska, All the Way to North (Part 4)
subtitle: On our way to Fairbanks, we find that we will go past Denali National Park. Of course, we won't miss out on this. Being one of eight national parks in Alaska, Denali is the most accessible one. There are parks that can only be reached by jets or boats. Others are either too far or not accessible due...

After being on our vehicle for over 4 hours, we finally arrive in Fairbanks. To start with, nothing is more fun than riding a snow mobile first time ever in my whole life. The control is similar to a motorcycle, but the feeling is totally different. We are on snow that's deeper than our ankle, which means the friction is reasonably minimal and we can drive faster and faster until we can tolerate the bone-chilling wind no more. It's so furious and exciting, especially considering all this happens in the woods. One careless move, and we can get seriously injured. We are literally out of the woods when we get off the vehicles (pun intended).

We are staying in a cottage tonight. Far away from the city, it is an ideal place to observe northern lights and the night sky. The weather is good, too. We can see some greenish luminescence hanging in the sky, very nebulous. Compared with daytime photography, It takes a lot more effort to take photos in such low-light situation. I manage to get a series of long-exposure images towards the vague light in the distance. These photos reveal the northern lights in real motion.

In the meantime, my fellow photographer Yanyou is capturing the stars. She has a wide-angle lens that's just perfect for shooting star trails. It's getting late and cold, we flee to our cottage and have some chitchats around the warm fireplace before going to bed.

It's time to say good bye. We are on the flight back to Anchorage. The bird-eye view is so stunning I almost forget to take photos. I have to exclaim that the topography is so abundant and motley.

We are about to fly back home. The past week has been so wonderful and memorable. I would like to thank my companions, Jin my jocular buddy and Yanyou the professional photographer. This journey is not possible without you guys.
